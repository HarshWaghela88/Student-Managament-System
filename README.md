## ðŸ’¡ What I Did

I built a beginner-friendly Java project to practice:

- Creating and using classes (`Student`)
- Using `ArrayList` to store and manage records
- Implementing a menu-driven interface for user interaction
- Using `Scanner` for input and handling basic logic for add, view, update, and delete operations

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Save the file as `StudentManagementSystem.java`
2. Compile and run it using a Java IDE (like VS Code or IntelliJ) or terminal:

```bash
javac StudentManagementSystem.java
